       "1. **Adaptive Control**: Adaptive control concerns algorithms for improving a sequence of decisions from experience. It is used in dynamic systems where states and actions are vectors, and system dynamics are smooth. Reinforcement learning can be applied to improve control decisions in these systems<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/9605/9605103v1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",

RL algorithms assign credit to actions based on reinforcement from the environment, which can take the form of a cost update or a measurable quantity such as bandwidth or end-to-end delay<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0207/0207073v1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",

       "Reinforcement learning (RL) has found applications in various domains, leveraging its ability to enable agents to learn from interaction with an environment to achieve a goal. Some use cases for reinforcement learning include:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Adaptive Control**: Adaptive control involves improving a sequence of decisions from experience. It is particularly useful in dynamic systems where states and actions are vectors, and system dynamics are smooth. RL algorithms have been applied to adaptive control problems, allowing systems to learn from experience and improve their decision-making processes<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/9605/9605103v1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">source</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Routing Algorithms**: RL has been employed in routing algorithms, where it is used to populate routing tables by learning the entries. The probabilistic nature of routing tables in RL algorithms makes them suitable for both single-path and multi-path routing, providing routers with the flexibility to make non-deterministic forwarding decisions based on learned probabilities<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0207/0207073v1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">source</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Personalized Recommendation Systems**: Reinforcement learning has been used to create personalized recommendation systems, particularly in the context of music recommendation. By simulating the interaction process and continuously updating the model based on user preferences for songs and song transitions, RL algorithms can provide more effective recommendations for song sequences that match listeners' preferences<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206183/\" target=\"_blank\">source</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Epidemic Modeling**: RL has been applied in epidemic modeling to explicitly consider the consequences of individual decisions on the spread of diseases. By minimizing agents' cost functions, RL algorithms can solve for optimal decisions for individual agents in the framework of game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning, enabling predictions about the spread of diseases<sup><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12959v1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">source</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Game Playing**: In the context of game playing, RL algorithms have been used to converge to the minimax strategy, particularly in the presence of minimax players. RL models can also take advantage of environmental players with limited rationality, showcasing their adaptability to various gaming scenarios<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0004/0004001v1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">source</a></sup>.\n",
