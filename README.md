Your organization requires a Multi-Channel Smart Chatbot and a search engine capable of comprehending diverse types of data scattered across various locations. Additionally, the conversational chatbot should be able to provide answers to inquiries, along with the source and an explanation of how and where the answer was obtained. In other words, you want **private and secured ChatGPT for your organization that can interpret, comprehend, and answer questions about your business data**.

The goal of the POC is to show/prove the value of a GPT Virtual Assistant built with Azure Services, with your own data in your own environment. The deliverables are:

1. Backend Bot API built with Bot Framework and exposed to multiple channels (Web Chat, MS Teams, SMS, Email, Slack, etc)
2. Frontend web application with a Search and a Bot UI.

The repo is made to teach you step-by-step on how to build a OpenAI-based Smart Search Engine. Each Notebook builds on top of each other and ends in building the two applications.

**For Microsoft FTEs:** This is a customer funded VBD, below the assets for the delivery.

# Architecture 
![Architecture](./images/GPT-Smart-Search-Architecture.jpg "Architecture")

## Flow
1. The user asks a question.
2. In the app, an OpenAI GPT-4 LLM uses a clever prompt to determine which source to use based on the user input
3. Five types of sources are available:
   * 3a. Azure SQL Database - contains COVID-related statistics in the US.
   * 3b. API Endpoints - RESTful OpenAPI 3.0 API containing up-to-date statistics about Covid.
   * 3c. Azure Bing Search API - provides access to the internet allowing scenerios like: QnA on public websites .
   * 3d. Azure AI Search - contains AI-enriched documents from Blob Storage:
       - 10,000 Arxiv Computer Science PDFs  
       - 90,000 Covid publication abstracts
       - 5 lenghty PDF books
   * 3f. CSV Tabular File - contains COVID-related statistics in the US.
   * 3g. Kraken broker API for currencies
4. The app retrieves the result from the source and crafts the answer.
5. The tuple (Question and Answer) is saved to CosmosDB as persistent memory and for further analysis.
6. The answer is delivered to the user.

## **Steps to Run the POC/Accelerator**

Note: (Pre-requisite) You need to have an Azure OpenAI service already created

1. Fork this repo to your Github account.
2. In Azure OpenAI studio, deploy these models (older models than the ones stated below won't work):
   - "gpt-35-turbo-1106 (or newer)" 
   - "gpt-4-turbo-1106  (or newer)"
   - "text-embedding-ada-002 (or newer)"
3. Create a Resource Group where all the assets of this accelerator are going to be. Azure OpenAI can be in different RG or a different Subscription.
4. ClICK BELOW to create all the Azure Infrastructure needed to run the Notebooks (Azure AI Search, Cognitive Services, etc):

[![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fpablomarin%2FGPT-Azure-Search-Engine%2Fmain%2Fazuredeploy.json) 

**Note**: If you have never created a `Azure AI Services Multi-Service account` before, please create one manually in the azure portal to read and accept the Responsible AI terms. Once this is deployed, delete this and then use the above deployment button.

5. Clone your Forked repo to your AML Compute Instance. If your repo is private, see below in Troubleshooting section how to clone a private repo.

6. Make sure you run the notebooks on a **Python 3.10 conda enviroment** or newer
7. Install the dependencies on your machine (make sure you do the below pip comand on the same conda environment that you are going to run the notebooks. For example, in AZML compute instance run:
```
conda activate azureml_py310_sdkv2
pip install -r ./common/requirements.txt
```

You might get some pip dependancies errors, but that is ok, the libraries were installed correctly regardless of the error.

8. Edit the file `credentials.env` with your own values from the services created in step 4.
9. **Run the Notebooks in order**. They build up on top of each other.

<summary>FAQs</summary>
  
## **FAQs**

1. **Why use Azure AI Search engine to provide the context for the LLM and not fine tune the LLM instead?**

A: Quoting the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning): "GPT-3 has been pre-trained on a vast amount of text from the open internet. When given a prompt with just a few examples, it can often intuit what task you are trying to perform and generate a plausible completion. This is often called "few-shot learning.
Fine-tuning improves on few-shot learning by training on many more examples than can fit in the prompt, letting you achieve better results on a wide number of tasks. Once a model has been fine-tuned, you won't need to provide examples in the prompt anymore. This **saves costs and enables lower-latency requests**"

However, fine-tuning the model requires providing hundreds or thousands of Prompt and Completion tuples, which are essentially query-response samples. The purpose of fine-tuning is not to give the LLM knowledge of the company's data but to provide it with examples so it can perform tasks really well without requiring examples on every prompt.

There are cases where fine-tuning is necessary, such as when the examples contain proprietary data that should not be exposed in prompts or when the language used is highly specialized, as in healthcare, pharmacy, or other industries or use cases where the language used is not commonly found on the internet.

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard. [Add a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key).
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Then select and copy the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file
# displayed in the terminal to your clipboard
```
- On GitHub, go to **Settings-> SSH and GPG Keys-> New SSH Key**
- In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. "AML Compute". In the "Key" field, paste your public key.
