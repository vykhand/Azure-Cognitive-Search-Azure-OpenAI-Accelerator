    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We manually loaded an index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books-vector\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools and built the first Skill/Agent, that can do RAG over a search engine\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We build a second Agent (Pandas) in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 08**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
    "- **Notebook 09**: We used another  Agent in order to talk to the Bing Search API and create a Bing Chat Clone and implemented callbacks for real-time streaming and tool information\n",
    "- **Notebook 10**: We built an API Agent that can translate a question into the right API calls, giving us the capability to talk to any datasource that provides a RESTFul API.\n",

These tools themselves can be other agents, each possessing their own set of tools.

       "\n",
       "1. **Increased Severity in Critically Ill Patients**: Obesity is highly frequent among critically ill patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection, and it remains challenging to elucidate the mechanisms by which the severity of SARS-Cov-2 is increased in the context of obesity<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365275/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Finite Markov Chains**:\n",
      "   - A discrete Markov chain is completely described by its initial distribution and its transition probability matrix^1. The transition probability matrix Q is stochastic, i.e., all entries are non-negative, all column sums are equal to 1, and no row contains only zeros.\n",
      "   - Markov chains and signal models are related by associating time/space marks to the states and the shift matrix to the transition probability matrix Q^1.\n",
      "   - The application of Markov chains in signal models provides a rigorous mathematical connection^1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Particle Transport Prediction**:\n",
      "   - A combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and Markov chain method has been developed for predicting transient particle transport in enclosed environments^2.\n",
      "   - The Markov chain technique provides faster-than-real-time information about particle transport in enclosed environments^2.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Fast Fluid Dynamics and Markov Chain Model**:\n",
      "   - A fast fluid dynamics (FFD) and Markov chain model has been proposed for predicting transient particle transport indoors, showing good agreement with experimental data and significant computational efficiency^4.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Spatial Markov Chain Model for Virus Spread**:\n",
      "   - A spatial Markov chain model has been developed for the spread of viruses, representing a graph connecting nodes that represent humans and incorporating various lockdown scenarios^5.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Genetic Fitness Optimization**:\n",
      "   - Markov chains are used in genetic computing for fitness optimization, and rapidly mixing Markov chains have been the basis of randomized approximation algorithms, combinatorial counting, statistical physics, and combinatorial optimization^6.\n",
