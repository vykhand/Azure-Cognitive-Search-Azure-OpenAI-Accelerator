    "\n",
    "But before dealing with the utility chain needed, let's first review the concept of Embeddings and Vector Search and RAG. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Embeddings and Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Azure OpenAI documentation ([HERE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings?tabs=python)), An embedding is a special format of data representation that can be easily utilized by machine learning models and algorithms. The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Vectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are essential for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic Richness**: They convert the semantic meaning of text into mathematical vectors, capturing nuances that simple keyword searches miss. This makes them incredibly powerful for understanding and processing language.\n",
    "- **Human-like Searching**: Searching using vector distances mimics the human approach to finding information based on context and meaning, rather than relying solely on exact word matches.\n",
    "- **Efficiency in Scale**: Vector representations allow for efficient handling and searching of large datasets. By reducing complex text to numerical vectors, algorithms can quickly sift through vast amounts of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding LLM Tokens' Context Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT come with a token limit for each input, which poses a challenge when dealing with lengthy documents or extensive data sets. This limitation restricts the model's ability to understand and generate responses based on the full context of the information provided. It becomes crucial, therefore, to devise strategies that can effectively manage and circumvent this limitation to leverage the full power of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, the solution incorporates several key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Segmenting Documents**: Breaking down large documents into smaller, manageable segments.\n",
    "2. **Vectorization of Chunks**: Converting these segments into vectors, making them compatible with vector-based search techniques.\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Search**: Employing both vector and text search methods to pinpoint the most relevant segments in relation to the query.\n",
    "4. **Optimal Context Provision**: Presenting the LLM with the most pertinent segments, ensuring a balance between detail and brevity to stay within token limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ultimate goal is to rely solely on vector indexes and hybrid searchs (vector + text). While it is possible to manually code parsers with OCR for various file types and develop a scheduler to synchronize data with the index, there is a more efficient alternative: **Azure AI Search has automated chunking strategies and vectorization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that **document segmentation and vectorization have already been completed in AI Azure Search**, as seen in the `ordered_content` dictionary. This pre-processing step simplifies subsequent operations, ensuring rapid response times and adherence to the token limits of the chosen OpenAI model.\n"

       "1. **Nitric Oxide (NO•)**: Although nitric oxide is known to have anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties, its role in lung inflammation is complex. In some disease models, it contributes to lung injury, but the context does not provide conclusive evidence of its use as a medicine to reduce lung inflammation.\n",

       "2. **Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1)** and **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**: HO-1 is an inducible stress protein that confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress and has anti-inflammatory effects. CO, a product of HO-1 activity, at low concentrations can have anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. This suggests a potential role for HO-1/CO in reducing lung inflammation.\n",

It has anti-inflammatory properties and could be used as an influenza treatment, which may imply a role in reducing lung inflammation.\n",

       "5. **Corticosteroids**: Corticosteroids are mentioned in the context of various treatment therapies tried in the management of patients with ARDS, which includes reducing lung inflammation.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Surfactant Protein-D (SP-D)**: SP-D participates in the innate response to inhaled microorganisms and contributes to immune and inflammatory regulation within the lung. Deficient accumulation of SP-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of human lung diseases, suggesting its role in managing lung inflammation.\n",

However, it's important to note that the effectiveness, safety, and mechanisms of action of these treatments can vary, and more research may be needed to fully understand their potential as medicines for reducing lung inflammation."

      "Several medicines and treatments have been identified that may reduce inflammation in the lungs:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1)**: This inducible stress protein confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress and has anti-inflammatory effects that can limit tissue damage in response to proinflammatory stimuli. HO-1 can prevent allograft rejection after transplantation and reduce inflammation. Administration of carbon monoxide (CO) at low concentrations can substitute for HO-1 with respect to anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting a role for CO as a mediator of HO-1 function in the lungs<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC193681/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",

      "2. **Clarithromycin**: This antimicrobial agent, also known as an immunomodulator, significantly suppressed RSV-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines and PAF receptor expression, which mediates adhesion of Streptococcus pneumoniae to host cells<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3384978/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[4]</a></sup>.\n",
