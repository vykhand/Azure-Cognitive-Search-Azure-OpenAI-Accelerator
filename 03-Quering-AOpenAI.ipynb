    "\n",
    "But before dealing with the utility chain needed, let's first review the concept of Embeddings and Vector Search and RAG. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Embeddings and Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Azure OpenAI documentation ([HERE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings?tabs=python)), An embedding is a special format of data representation that can be easily utilized by machine learning models and algorithms. The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Vectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are essential for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic Richness**: They convert the semantic meaning of text into mathematical vectors, capturing nuances that simple keyword searches miss. This makes them incredibly powerful for understanding and processing language.\n",
    "- **Human-like Searching**: Searching using vector distances mimics the human approach to finding information based on context and meaning, rather than relying solely on exact word matches.\n",
    "- **Efficiency in Scale**: Vector representations allow for efficient handling and searching of large datasets. By reducing complex text to numerical vectors, algorithms can quickly sift through vast amounts of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding LLM Tokens' Context Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT come with a token limit for each input, which poses a challenge when dealing with lengthy documents or extensive data sets. This limitation restricts the model's ability to understand and generate responses based on the full context of the information provided. It becomes crucial, therefore, to devise strategies that can effectively manage and circumvent this limitation to leverage the full power of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, the solution incorporates several key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Segmenting Documents**: Breaking down large documents into smaller, manageable segments.\n",
    "2. **Vectorization of Chunks**: Converting these segments into vectors, making them compatible with vector-based search techniques.\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Search**: Employing both vector and text search methods to pinpoint the most relevant segments in relation to the query.\n",
    "4. **Optimal Context Provision**: Presenting the LLM with the most pertinent segments, ensuring a balance between detail and brevity to stay within token limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ultimate goal is to rely solely on vector indexes and hybrid searchs (vector + text). While it is possible to manually code parsers with OCR for various file types and develop a scheduler to synchronize data with the index, there is a more efficient alternative: **Azure AI Search has automated chunking strategies and vectorization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that **document segmentation and vectorization have already been completed in AI Azure Search**, as seen in the `ordered_content` dictionary. This pre-processing step simplifies subsequent operations, ensuring rapid response times and adherence to the token limits of the chosen OpenAI model.\n"

       "Based on the provided context, several medicines and therapeutic approaches have been mentioned that reduce inflammation in the lungs:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Chloroquine: In human lung parenchymal explants, a clinically achievable concentration of chloroquine (100 μM) inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, CCL2, and CCL3, which could also mitigate the cytokine storm associated with severe pneumonia caused by coronaviruses.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Recombinant IL-22: Administering recombinant IL-22 in vivo has been shown to reduce inflammation and fluid leak into the lung, demonstrating the potential of targeting the IL-22/IL-22BP axis for reducing influenza-induced pneumonia.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Low doses of radiation therapy (RT): Low doses of RT (0.5-1 Gy) increased IL-10 secretion and decreased IFNγ production in the culture supernatant of Poly(I:C)-stimulated human lung macrophages, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy to counteract lung inflammation.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Anti-inflammatory pharmacological therapies: These therapies aim to inhibit excessive inflammation or manipulate the resulting physiological derangement causing respiratory failure. Cell-based therapy is an emerging approach that seeks to convert the inflammatory process from an injurious one to a reparative one.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. IL-6 blockade with tocilizumab: In selected patients with severe, rapidly deteriorating COVID-19-related pneumonia, IL-6 blockade with tocilizumab could curb the cytokine storm, prevent ICU admission, and the requirement for mechanical ventilation.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Glucocorticoids: Although glucocorticoids are considered effective anti-inflammatory therapies for chronic inflammatory and immune diseases like asthma, they may be relatively ineffective in certain populations such as asthmatic smokers, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis (CF).\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Escin: Escin, an agent with potent anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects in lung injury, has been suggested as a potential add-on therapy in acute lung injury (ALI) related to COVID-19 infection.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. Anti-inflammatory therapy in neonates: Early post-natal anti-inflammatory therapy could help in preventing the development of chronic lung disease (CLD) in preterm newborns who may be unable to activate the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. Noscapine: Noscapine, a cough medicine, has been shown to inhibit the bradykinin-enhanced cough response in humans, suggesting it may help attenuate the intense immunological reaction seen in the lung tissue during viral infections like SARS-CoV-2.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. Pharmacological management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Rapid-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics are key to managing exacerbations of COPD and preventing exacerbations should also be a component of therapy for the disease.\n",
       "\n",
       "11. Macrolide and ketolide antibiotics: These antibiotics may exert anti-inflammatory effects on the chronically inflamed airways in addition to their anti-infective action and may play a role in the management of asthma.\n",
       "\n",
       "These are just some of the medicines and approaches mentioned in the context provided that are associated with reducing lung inflammation. It is important to note that the effectiveness and safety of these treatments can vary based on the specific condition being treated, the patient's overall health, and other factors. Clinical judgment and appropriate medical consultation are essential for the proper management of lung inflammation."

Low doses of radiation therapy (RT) have been used to increase IL-10 secretion by lung macrophages and decrease IFNγ production, which suggests a mechanism for regulating lung inflammation and favoring anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion by lung macrophages<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.077651\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a></sup>.\n",
